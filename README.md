# Komatsu_HD_785-7_Part_Number_Bot
Komatsu HD 785-7 Part Number Bot, create with Javascript with node-telegram-bot-api package, and using SQL RDMS

- As we know that "Part Number Book" is very very much.
- Each series sometimes have different part number
- for example on Komatsu Hauler Truck HD785-7
- it's have many series, like japan series, indian, indonesian, etc
- Also, it's have different "generation"
- like: 20000 series, 30000 series, and so on.

# The Main Idea
- When We need to order one kind of part
- for one kind maintenance sometimes, it's need
- lot of part that have to ordered
- for example: we need to replace bushing of radius rod
- it would need very much of part to be ordered.
- And sometimes, the part number we would to be
- ordered, placed in different pages.
- It is give us to have extra time to done this job.
  
  => So, We need to make the job easier
  => With make that "group of part number"
  => place them into "database"
  => and We call them using telegram bot


  => So, when we need part numbers
  => just write on telegram bot
  => "like we search on google"
  => Just type, and boom, the part numbers we want
  => come to us.
